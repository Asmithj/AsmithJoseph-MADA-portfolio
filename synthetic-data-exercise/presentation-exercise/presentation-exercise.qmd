# Introduction

Visualization Exercise : Replicating the FiveThirtyEight Fatalities
Graph using AI Assistance

The objective of this exercise is to replicate a FiveThirtyEight graph
that visualizes airline fatalities adjusted for seat availability and
distance traveled between 1985-99 and 2000-14. I obtained the article
from
[FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-travelers-avoid-flying-airlines-that-have-had-crashes-in-the-past/).

The FiveThirtyEight article suggests that past crashes are not the best
indicator of an airline's current safety. Instead, it recommends
evaluating airlines based on their overall incident rates, including
non-fatal ones, which provide a more consistent safety measure. The
analysis also notes that airlines from wealthier countries typically
have better safety records due to stricter standards and regulations. A
composite "safety score" calculated using data on incidents and
fatalities helps rank airlines, with significant variations in safety
observed across different carriers and time periods.

The data was pulled from [FiveThirtyEight
Data](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/).

# Initial AI Prompt

My Prompt:

I am undertaking a project to replicate a graph from an online article.
Here’s how we'll proceed: 1) I will provide the link to the article, 2)
share the dataset, and 3) upload an image of the original graph. Your
task is to recreate the graph in RStudio, mirroring the original in
terms of variables, colors, and styles. I will be available throughout
the process to help with any adjustments you need to make.

AI Response:

Understood! Please provide the dataset, and I will generate RStudio code
to replicate the FiveThirtyEight visualization.

# Data Loading & Initial Visualization

User Prompt:

Load the dataset using the here package in R. Read and clean the data to
extract only relevant columns.

I Response & Code:

```{r}
# Load required libraries
if (!requireNamespace("here", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("here")
if (!requireNamespace("tidyverse", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("tidyverse")

library(here)
library(tidyverse)

# Define the file path using `here`
data_path <- here("presentation-exercise", "data", "airline-safety.csv")

# Read the CSV file
airline_data <- read_csv(data_path)

# Rename columns for clarity
airline_data_clean <- airline_data %>%
  rename(
    airline = airline,
    fatal_85_99 = fatalities_85_99,
    fatal_00_14 = fatalities_00_14
  )

```

# First Attempt at the Graph

My Prompt:

Generate a scatter plot where:

X-axis: Fatalities (1985-99) Y-axis: Fatalities (2000-14) Dots:
Represent airlines Trend Line: Add a flat red regression line (like in
the original graph) Label specific airlines (Kenya Airways, Malaysia
Airlines, China Airlines, Pakistan International, and Avianca)

# Load the data.

```{r}
# Load libraries
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)

# Define file path using `here`
data_path <- here("presentation-exercise", "data", "airline-safety.csv")

# Read the CSV file
airline_data <- read_csv(data_path)

# Check the first few rows of the dataset
head(airline_data)
```

# Data Preparation

```{r}
# Check the structure of the dataset
glimpse(airline_data)

# Rename columns for clarity (optional, keeping it consistent with the FiveThirtyEight graphs)
airline_data_clean <- airline_data %>%
  rename(
    airline = airline,
    fatal_accidents_85_99 = fatal_accidents_85_99,
    fatal_accidents_00_14 = fatal_accidents_00_14,
    fatalities_85_99 = fatalities_85_99,
    fatalities_00_14 = fatalities_00_14,
    incidents_85_99 = incidents_85_99,
    incidents_00_14 = incidents_00_14
  )

# Check for missing values
sum(is.na(airline_data_clean))

```

# First Attempt at the Graph

My Prompt:

Generate a scatter plot where:

X-axis: Fatalities (1985-99) Y-axis: Fatalities (2000-14) Dots:
Represent airlines Trend Line: Add a flat red regression line (like in
the original graph) Label specific airlines (Kenya Airways, Malaysia
Airlines, China Airlines, Pakistan International, and Avianca)

#Correcting Airline Positions My Prompt:

Adjust airline fatality positions to match the original graph.

Kenya Airways should be at (0, 1375) Malaysia Airlines should have two
dots at (0, 750) and (0, 500) China Airlines & Pakistan International
should be aligned at the same X-axis value. Avianca should be slightly
past 1000.

My prompt:

Let's proceed with the following revisions and adjustments to your
graph:

Adjust the positions of airline fatalities to match those in the
original graph:

Place Kenya Airways at coordinates (0, 1375). Position Malaysia Airlines
with two dots at coordinates (0, 750) and (0, 500). Align China Airlines
and Pakistan International on the same X-axis. Set Avianca slightly past
the 1000 mark on the X-axis. Change the font to Atlas Grotesk for all
text elements.

Adjust the label positions to ensure they sit right next to the
corresponding dot.

Modify the grid color to light gray, replicating the style of
FiveThirtyEight.

Add a shaded gray area at the bottom of the graph, incorporating the
FiveThirtyEight logo and source text for attribution.

# My Prompt:

Identify the differences between Graph 1 the original and the replicate

AI Response:

In the original graph, the labels for China Airlines and Pakistan
International need vertical adjustments for accuracy; they're positioned
too closely in the replicated graph. The red trend line should be flat
and end slightly past 1000, not extending too far as in the replication.
For Kenya Airways, the dot should align on the first y-grid line with
the label rightly spaced to the right—current positioning is off.
Malaysia Airlines' labels need to accurately reflect their placement
next to the first major y-grid line. Avianca's dot, closer to 1000 in
the original, is too far right in the replication and needs adjustment.
Generally, labels in the replicated graph are too close to the dots
compared to the original, where they are more spaced out, requiring
overall spacing corrections.

# (Part 2) Creating the Airline Safety Table

To build this table, I selected key variables on incidents, fatal
accidents, and fatalities for the periods 1985-1999 and 2000-2014,
filtering the data to highlight the 15 airlines with the highest total
fatalities.

Using gt(), I structured the table by adding a bold title, formatted
headers, and spanning columns for the two time periods. Airline names
were bolded for emphasis, and numerical values were simplified for
better readability. To enhance insights, I applied color-coded
conditional formatting, using a gradient scale from green (low
incidents) to red (high fatalities). A summary row was also included to
provide totals for incidents, fatal accidents, and fatalities, along
with a source note for attribution.
